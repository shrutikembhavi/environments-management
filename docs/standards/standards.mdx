# EPD Environment Management Standards

> *Principles* lead to *Standards* and *Standards* lead to *Guidelines.*

## Definitions

| Term         | Meaning                                                                                               |

| Principles   | A principle is an established value upon which decisions are made.                                |
| Standards    | A standard is a measurable goal or practice by which one may measure one's own actions or values.     |
| Guidelines   | A guideline is a suggested course of action which is given to keep one moving in the right direction. |

## Environment Management Standards versus Software Engineering Principles

1. *Principles* demonstrate key enginnering values and implementation may differ among EPD teams:
   - by expertise, product and service.
   - by choice of tools.
   - by programming language and technology stack.
2. *Standards* are common quality benchmarks all EPD teams can measure up against:
   - irrespective of their expertise, product and service.
   - irrespective of their of the tools in use.
   - irrespective of how they implement the principles in their programming language or technology stack.
3. *Guidelines* are recomendations that provide a practical method of achieving principles and standards:
   - by recognizing the best practises per expertise, product and service.
   - by recognizing the best practises per choice of tools.
   - by recognizing the best practises per programming language and technology stack.


## Objectives of Environment Management Standards

<details><summary>To define what an environment is</summary>
<p>

**Concept**
> an environment is an instance of an application, product or service an integrated set of technology components.

**Rationale**
> software environments that enable a value stream to deliver work and changes to their customers and can be physical or virtual machines, or be containerized or serverless.
</p>
</details>  

<details><summary>To enable transition to DevOps</summary>
<p>

**Concept**
> environment Management reduces risk and lays the path to adopting the DevOps way of working that accelerate your ability to deliver value to your customers.

**Rationale**
> In an ideal DevOps world, teams have the autonomy to experiment on their loosely coupled systems
in the real world enterprises have tightly coupled systems and the dependencies between them pose a risk. Managing these risks are key.
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>To reduce risks with shared infrastructure</summary>
<p>

**Concept**
> Environment management helps releases go faster and more safely, while reaping cost benefits from shared infrastruture

**Rationale**
> In an ideal DevOps world, each autonomous team manages their own instances of the environments. In the real world, environments are shared, m both because of dependancies and costs. 

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>To enhance each value stream</summary>
<p>

**Concept**
> accelerate your ability to deliver value to your customers. 

**Rationale**
> For value to be delivered to a customer, it needs to be built, tested, and deployed, with a set of good practices to provide an effective, end-to-end management service for all environments
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>To reduce risks from coexistance of different types of system architectures</summary>
<p>

**Concept**

> In the real world, both monoliths and mircoservices may coexist; monoliths present a high-risk of failures.

**Rationale**
> In an ideal DevOps world, teams have the autonomy to experiment on their loosely coupled microservices with Agile ways of working. In the real world enterprises have tightly coupled monoliths with heavy weight ITSM processes and outdated project / waterfall ways of working
